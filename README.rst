    **NOTE.** Use this section to create a minimal example of how to use the code in this repository. If your repository is mainly based on a number 
    of scripts, you could show how the most important scripts can be executed and what the most important parameters are. If your code is rather 
    used as a library you can write a simple code block that shows how to use the features of that library.

.. code-block:: python

    # The following code is just an example and not executable
    from chem_mat_data.dataset import Dataset
    from chem_mat_data.compute import Computation

    dataset = Dataest('name')
    computation = Computation(dataset)
    result = computation.compute()
    print(result)
